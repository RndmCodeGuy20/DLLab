# DLLab: Deep Learning Simulation Projects

DLLab is a repository for simulation projects in the field of deep learning. The projects are designed to give you
hands-on experience with implementing and training neural networks using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Each project consists of a set of Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the implementation and evaluation of a
specific neural network architecture or training algorithm. The notebooks include code snippets, explanations of key
concepts, and exercises to help you deepen your understanding of deep learning.
Projects

Here are the projects currently available in DLLab:

- **Project 1: Implementing Vanilla and Momentum based Gradient Descent :** In this project, I have implemented Vanilla
  Gradient Descent and Momentum Based Gradient Descent techniques using industry grade design patterns and code
  structure.

- **Project 2: Implementing AdaGrad and RMSProp :** In this project, I have implemented Adaptive
  Gradient Descent and RMSProp Gradient Descent techniques using industry grade design patterns and code
  structure.

## Getting Started

To get started with DLLab, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.

Each project has its own folder in the repository (e.g., Practical 1, Practical 2, etc.) and contains the `Jupyter
notebook(s)` and `Python source code` for that project. The source code for each project is stored in the src folder
within
the project folder.

To run the code for a particular project, navigate to the corresponding project folder and run the Python script(s) in
the src folder using the following command:

```powershell
python src/main.py
```

OR

```text
cd src/
py main.py
```

This will execute the main script for the project, which includes the code for implementing and training the neural
network(s) for that project.

If you prefer to work with the Jupyter notebook(s) for a project, you can open the notebook(s) in the project folder and
run the code cells interactively.

Note that some projects may have additional setup steps or data files that need to be downloaded or prepared before you
can run the code. Please refer to the README file in the project folder for specific instructions on how to run the
project.
